# CodeFoo9-FullStack
The Full Stack component of my application for IGN's Code Foo 9!

## About
- Live chat app built with Socket.io
- Scales to more than two users.
- My first project that dabbles in the backend (particularly HTTP servers/databases)!

### Ingredients
- Socket.io
- Express
- MongoDB Atlas
- Vanilla JavaScript + HTML/CSS

## Testing
This project requires an installation of Node.js and NPM on your machine.

After cloning this repository, open your terminal and `cd` into the root of the project folder.

Then, run the following commands:

`npm install`
Installs the project's dependencies.

`npm run start`
Starts the project. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to view the application.

Once the project loads, enter a username and begin chatting!

Oh boy... We have a problem. There aren't any other users to chat with!

Here's a little workaround, for testing purposes. To add more users to the chat, simply open a new window and once again, navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. Enter a different username and start chatting with yourself!

You can also chat with other users on different computers by accessing this project at:<br>

That's All Folks!
